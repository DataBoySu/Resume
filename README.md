## Education

- **SGT University**, Gurugram — B.Tech Computer Science (AI & ML Specialization), 2023–2027
  - CGPA: **9.44 / 10.00**
  - Relevant coursework: Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Databases, Statistics, Linear Algebra

## Experience

- **ML Team Lead** — CodeSangam Hackathon (Healthcare Track) — *3rd Place*, Feb 2024
  - Led a 4-person team to ship a Flask prototype in 48 hours: data collection, labeling, model training, evaluation, and deployment pipeline.
  - Curated an Ayurveda symptom/remedy dataset (web/PDF) and generated synthetic samples to improve minority-class balance.
  - Documented labeling guidelines and evaluation notes to speed iteration and reduce ambiguity.

- **Data Science Lead** — AIFusion Hackathon — *Special Recognition*, Sep–Oct 2024
  - Analyzed 10k+ loan customer records; engineered interaction features that improved ensemble accuracy to **92.8%** while reducing acquisition cost.
  - Built XGBoost/LightGBM/RandomForest ensembles, used SHAP for explainability, and produced decision rules for stakeholders.
  - Delivered concise technical reports (EDA, assumptions, evaluation split) to ensure reproducibility.

## Projects

- **StreaxBot** — React, Node.js, Express, Firestore, Gemini API — Oct 2024
  - Implemented an end-to-end quiz pipeline: topic input → web scraping → data cleaning → question generation → delivery.
  - Added real-time deduplication and guardrail prompts; sampling review reduced low-quality outputs.

- **Sentiment Modeling with Synthetic Augmentation** — PyTorch, Transformers, LoRA, ADASYN
  - Fine-tuned RoBERTa with LoRA adapters; ADASYN augmentation increased macro F1 by ~12% on an imbalanced multi-class task.
  - Published reproducible assets: dataset, preprocessing script, training notebook, and a concise model card.

## Leadership & Activities

- Self-directed paper summaries on model evaluation, interpretability, and data quality; integrated learnings into projects.
- Maintained lightweight experiment logs (configs, metrics, observations) to improve iteration discipline.
- Created benchmarking scripts to compare models and calibration approaches for small structured and text datasets.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **ML & Data:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Pandas, NumPy, SHAP, LoRA, ADASYN, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, F1, Calibration)
- **Data Engineering:** Web Scraping (Playwright), REST APIs, ETL, Data Cleaning, Deduplication, JSON
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Docker (basic), Jupyter, Experiment Tracking (logs & scripts)
- **Concepts:** Prompt Design, Feature Attribution, Reproducibility, Documentation, Agile Collaboration

## Honors & Achievements

- CGPA **9.44 / 10** (AI & ML specialization)
- 3rd Place — CodeSangam Hackathon (Healthcare Track)
- Special Recognition — AIFusion Hackathon (Data Quality)
- Built multiple original datasets (NLP sentiment, healthcare symptoms) enabling ML prototypes.
